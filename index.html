      <h2><span>Profile</span></h2>
      <div class="content">
        <p>As an established web applications developer with ~20 years of professional experience, I have focused on building applications for start ups, small/medium/large businesses, and web services. I've used lots of technologies over that period including Erlang/Elixir, Java, Ruby, Node, Javascript, Golang, C#, and Python.</p>

        <p>I'm versatile in SQL and NoSQL databases choosing PostgreSQL and MongoDb as my favorites in those two disciplines.</p>

        <p>I am experienced working in small teams or by himself, and am very comfortable leading and building teams for projects; it's not uncommon to lead remote teams.</p>

        <p>As well, I have over 10 years of experience managing projects, from pitching the initial ideas, to hiring, leading, coding, documenting, and launching the finished product.</p>

        <p>I'm looking to work with people who are my peers or better; people who push and challenge me; people who know there is no end to the future of tech and are excited to be a continuous part of that future.</p>

            <p>I was invited to work on TWB as a transition
consultant. My task was to help migrate the current code from their
previous hosting environment to a new one, to help debug some of the
issues they had with the code, to help train a team of Java developers
in Ruby and Ruby on Rails, and to make sure that the team could take
over the project once the transition was done.</p>

            <p>I ended up spending a little over a month in
training, setting up EC2 instances, and helping port certain parts of
the code base over to newer technologies. The code base started as a
LuvdByLess and educommons fork. Almost every portion of the LuvdByLess
side was been replaced with new code and moved in to a project called
luvfoo. That project is now opensourced.</p>

            <p>I really liked the open source nature of this
project. It's every geeks dream to be paid to work on Open
Source projects, and it's always one that I pursue as often as
possible.</p>

              <p>Truelobby was created as the new way to communicate
with your state and federal representatives. It brings modern
communication to congressional houses, and allow a very personal touch
to things that effect our lives daily.</p>
              <p>I was brought in to this project after most of
the design for the site was done. The site is being tested in the State
of Washington and had a hard deadline in mid January; to be built,
tested, run through a beta, and launched into production. I was
brought on mid December and recommended a crew of four individuals,
including myself, two of which I hand picked, and the other whom had
applied for the position I had at the same time (I was made the
secondary Lead Developer as a time zone overlap).</p>
              <p>My job was to take over from an initial bort
setup, build a team, set project requirements, guide the team, and code
myself. The crew used several plugins and I ended up committing
changes to those repositories to fix issues that they ran in to as they
were going along.</p>
              <p>They had a near flawless launch with only two minor
Internet Explorer ajax bugs (which got fixed very shortly after). They
had over a thousand customers sign up on day one as well as the full
support of the Legislators from the State of Washington. It was an
exhilarating experience.</p>
