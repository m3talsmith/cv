          <p>As an established web applications developer with over 15 
years of professional experience, Michael has focused on building 
applications for start ups, small businesses, and web services. He has 
used many technologies to accomplish this, ranging from Flash and 
Actionscript on the interface side, to using Ruby on Rails, python, PHP,
 or even Java on the server side.</p>
          
          <p>He is adept at setting up servers for deployments to run on, and hardening said servers against attacks.</p>
          
          <p>He has experience working in small teams or by himself, and
 is very comfortable leading and building teams for projects; and has 
done this remotely as well as on site.</p>
          
          <p>He has over 10 years of experience managing projects, from 
pitching the initial ideas, to hiring, leading, coding, documenting, and
 launching the finished product.</p>

          <h3>Teachers Without Borders - Senior Developer, Trainer, and Transition Consultant</h3>
          <a href="http://teacherswithoutborders.org/">teacherswithoutborders.org</a>
          <div class="summary">
            <ul>
              <li>Transition Consulting</li>
              <li>Training new crew in Ruby on Rails and Python</li>
              <li>Bug Fixes</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="content">
              <p>Michael was invited to work on TWB as a transition 
consultant. His task was to help migrate the current code from their 
previous hosting environment to a new one, to help debug some of the 
issues they had with the code, to help train a team of Java developers 
in Ruby and Ruby on Rails, and to make sure that the team could take 
over the project once the transition was done.</p>

              <p>Michael ended up spending a little over a month in 
training, setting up EC2 instances, and helping port certain parts of 
the code base over to newer technologies. The code base started as a 
LuvdByLess and educommons fork. Almost every portion of the LuvdByLess 
side has been replaced with new code and moved in to a project called 
luvfoo. That project is now opensourced and he still contributes code to
 it.</p>

              <p>Michael really liked the open source nature of this 
project. He was able to release the EC2 images as Public images in 
Amazon, he was able to fork and move the project from using 
attach_fu/file_column to paperclip, and he was able to be paid to 
support this project. It's every geeks dream to be paid to work on Open 
Source projects, and it's always one that he'd pursue as often as 
possible.</p>

               <p>Truelobby was created as the new way to communicate 
with your state and federal representatives. It brings modern 
communication to congressional houses, and allow a very personal touch 
to things that effect our lives daily.</p>
               <p>Michael was brought in to this project after most of 
the design for the site was done. The site is being tested in the State 
of Washington and had a hard deadline in mid January; to be built, 
tested, run through a beta, and launched into production. Michael was 
brought on mid December and recommended a crew of four individuals, 
including himself, two of which he hand picked, and the other who had 
applied for the position he had at the same time (he was made the 
secondary Lead Developer as a time zone overlap).</p>
               <p>Michael's job was to take over from an initial bort 
setup, build a team, set project requirements, guide the team, and code 
himself. The crew used several plugins and he ended up committing 
changes to those repositories to fix issues that they ran in to as they 
were going along.</p>
               <p>They had a near flawless launch with only two minor 
Internet Explorer ajax bugs (which got fixed very shortly after). They 
had over a thousand customers sign up on day one as well as the full 
support of the Legislators from the State of Washington. It was an 
exhilarating experience.</p>
